# Property deduplication across portals

Today, a **publication** is attached to a **property** at scrape time via a strict `propertyKey` fingerprint, with a secondary fuzzy match (`propertiesMatchFuzzy`) when keys differ. A manual **reconcile** pass can merge duplicates already in the database. Enrichment runs later and may fill fields (surface, rooms, land, description) that were missing or incomplete at scrape time, but it does not re-run deduplication.

This design trades simplicity and low false-merge risk against missed merges: two portal ads for the same home can remain separate when structural fields disagree at first insert (e.g. `surface: null` on Logic-Immo vs `110` on Leboncoin), or when the second publication appears in a later scrape and fuzzy match fails. Reconcile fixes this only if an operator runs it manually.

## Decision

Replace the binary fuzzy matcher with a **tolerance score**, and run deduplication **deferred** — automatically after each scrape and when enrichment updates structural fields. Do **not** use description/title text similarity.

## Considered options

### A — Tolerance score (adopted)

Replace all-or-nothing `propertiesMatchFuzzy` with a weighted score per field pair. Two candidates merge when the score reaches a configurable threshold.

**Hard gates** (score = 0, no merge):

- Different or missing `postalCode` on either side
- Conflicting `isNewProperty` (`true` vs `false` when both set)

**Hard vetoes** stay binary; everything else is scored:

| Signal              | Behaviour                                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `price`             | Full credit within ±2 %; partial credit sliding down to 0 beyond tolerance                       |
| `surface`           | Full credit if equal; partial if one side is `null`; 0 if both set and different                 |
| `rooms`, `bedrooms` | Same pattern as `surface`                                                                        |
| `landSurface`       | Full credit if equal or one `null`; partial within ±5 %; 0 beyond                                |
| `propertyType`      | Full credit if canonical types match; partial if one side `null`; 0 if both set and incompatible |

Weights favour high-confidence signals (`postalCode` is a gate, not a weight; `price` and `surface` weigh more than `propertyType`). The threshold (starting point: **≥ 0.85**) is configurable and tuned against real false-positive / false-negative cases.

**Pros:** Handles incomplete portal data without per-field special cases; one algorithm for scrape-time linking and reconcile. **Cons:** Requires test fixtures for score boundaries; threshold tuning is ongoing.

### B — Deferred dedup (adopted)

Keep scrape-time linking for exact `propertyKey` matches. Additionally:

1. Run fuzzy reconcile automatically after each successful scrape.
2. When enrichment updates `surface`, `rooms`, `bedrooms`, or `landSurface`, re-evaluate merge candidates in the same postal code.
3. Log near-misses (score just below threshold) and hard vetoes with field breakdown for prod diagnosis.

Reuse `mergePropertiesIntoCanonical` for the actual merge; only the _match predicate_ changes.

### C — Text similarity (rejected)

Description/title similarity (e.g. shared prefix _CAMPAGNE DE BREAUTE_) is not used. Too risky: same agency, same development, templated copy. Revisit only if tolerance scoring + deferred dedup leave a measured gap.

### D — Scheduled reconcile only (rejected)

Cron reconcile without rule changes does not fix enrichment timing or null-field mismatches.

## Consequences

- `propertiesMatchFuzzy` becomes a thin wrapper over `scorePropertyMatch >= threshold`, or is replaced outright.
- Duplicate properties should collapse without manual `/reconcile` in normal operation; the admin endpoint remains for on-demand runs.
- `firstSeenAt` / canonical property selection stays “oldest property wins”.
- Tests must cover: score boundaries, cross-scrape merge, post-enrichment merge, hard vetoes (`isNewProperty` conflict), and regression cases that must not merge (same postal code, different homes).
